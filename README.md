http://www.compjour.org/lessons/flask-single-page/hello-tiny-flask-app/

Assumes you have:

1. [Installed Python 3.x via Anaconda on your computer](http://2017.compciv.org/guide/topics/python/installing-python-via-anaconda.html?highlight=anaconda), which should include Flask, among other things.
2. Created a Heroku account
3. Have Git installed (which you probably do if you installed the [Github Desktop app at some point](https://desktop.github.com/))


# Steps


1. Copy the files in this repo.
2. Run `heroku create`
3. Run `git init`
4. Run `git add .`
5. Run `git commit -m 'first'`
6. Run `git push heroku master`
